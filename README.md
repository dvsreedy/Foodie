# Foodie
Built an android application for students to get to know about all the food places around our college and also about various items in the menu.
It also provides recommendations for a best restaurant for a particular food item based on user ratings, timings at which the food item is available as well as the price of it.
Also integrated Google maps to the app, to make it easier for newcomers to visit the place.\
Also synced the ratings to cloud using Google firebase.
